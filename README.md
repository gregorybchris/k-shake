# K-Shake

This project is the result of an impromptu mini-hackathon, collaborating with [Yuki](https://github.com/yzan424) and [Max](https://github.com/tekknolagi).

Seattle had just felt a [magnitude 4.6 earthquake](https://www-1.thenewstribune.com/news/state/washington/article232585377.html) and we decided to combine our interests of data science and graphics to uncover structure in world earthquake data.
